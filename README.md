You need to install ngrok to connect to other players.

For installing ngrok, go to https://ngrok.com/download and follow the instructions. Remember to create an account for the second step, adding authtoken.

After isntalling it, we can start a tunnel on the internet with the following commands:

For http protocol:
> ngrok.exe http portnumber
For tcp protocol:
> ngrok.exe http portnumber
